Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to applying engineering principles in designing, and development of software products.
It is important in creation of software applications such as Windows and Facebook. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software Engineering has evolved from the 1940s to date. Key developers include Alan Turing, Grace Hopper
Key milestones include; development of programming languages, establishing software engineering as a discipline and rise of Agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - assessing user needs and system requirements
Design - creation of high level software architecture and user interface.
implementation- writing code and building the software.
Testing- testing the standards of the Software for quality assurance.
Deployment- releasing the software to users
Maintenance- providing ongoing support and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodologies involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility e.g where changes needs to be made.
Waterfall methodologies involve sequential approache with phases  e,g the different phases of the life cycle. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a Software Developer, writes the code and implements the software. 
a Quality Assurance Engineer, ensures quality and executes tests.
a Project Manager, oversees the whole process to delivery of softwares.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) refers to Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing e.g visual studio
Version Control Systems (VCS) refers to tools for tracking changes to source code and team work e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges - high costs, tight deadlines, and changing needs.
Strategies to overcome- proper communication, prioritization, and flexibility 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing refers to individual components testing
integration testing refers to testing interaction between different components.
system testing refers to testing user requirements vs the software.
acceptance testing refers to ensuring user needs are met.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting questions to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It is important in getting the best responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Write an email to my boss"
Better- Draft an email to my boss, this is the topic. Include a clear reference, an introduction, and conclusion. "
One gets better and coincise responses.
